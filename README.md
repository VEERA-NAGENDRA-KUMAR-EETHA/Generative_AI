For this project I used google colab to type code, open AI api keys for retriving the bulk data. 
I used Gradio library in python to get the chatbot interface.
Used Hugging Face website to link some spaces for api keys and repo Id's.
At last link the HTML, CSS and JS code using VScode software and add the gradio link from Hugging Face.
